# 🌧️ Exploratory Analysis of Rainfall Data in India for Agriculture

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of rainfall patterns across India, with a particular emphasis on their impact on agriculture. By analyzing historical rainfall data, the project aims to uncover trends, seasonal variations, and anomalies that influence crop productivity and agricultural planning.

The insights derived can help in:
- Understanding rainfall distribution across regions.
- Identifying drought-prone and flood-prone areas.
- Supporting agricultural decision-making and policy development.

## ⚙️ Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling, and encoding.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Statistical summaries, seasonal trends, and regional comparisons.
- **Visualization**: Heatmaps, line plots, and distribution charts for rainfall intensity.
- **Agricultural Insights**: Linking rainfall variability to crop cycles and productivity.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis
- **Scikit-learn** for preprocessing and potential predictive modeling
